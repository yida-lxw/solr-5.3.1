/**
 * A {@link DocValuesFormat} to efficiently index geo-spatial lat/lon points
 * from {@link BKDPointField} for fast bounding-box ({@link BKDPointInBBoxQuery})
 * and polygon ({@link BKDPointInPolygonQuery}) queries.
 *
 * <p>This wraps {@link Lucene50DocValuesFormat}, but saves its own BKD tree
 * structures to disk for fast query-time intersection. See <a
 * href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~pankaj/publications/papers/bkd-sstd.pdf">this paper</a>
 * for details.
 *
 * <p>The BKD tree slices up 2D (lat/lon) space into smaller and
 * smaller rectangles, until the smallest rectangles have approximately
 * between X/2 and X (X default is 1024) points in them, at which point
 * such leaf cells are written as a block to disk, while the index tree
 * structure records how space was sub-divided is loaded into HEAP
 * at search time.  At search time, the tree is recursed based on whether
 * each of left or right child overlap with the query shape, and once
 * a leaf block is reached, all documents in that leaf block are collected
 * if the cell is fully enclosed by the query shape, or filtered and then
 * collected, if not.
 *
 * <p>The index is also quite compact, because docs only appear once in
 * the tree (no "prefix terms").
 *
 * <p>In addition to the files written by {@link Lucene50DocValuesFormat}, this format writes:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><tt>.kdd</tt>: BKD leaf data and index</li>
 *   <li><tt>.kdm</tt>: BKD metadata</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The disk format is experimental and free to change suddenly, and this code likely has new and exciting bugs!
